                    <!-- I am going to use custom directives here. -->

                    <!--The first thing to remember
                         about custom directives in AngularJS is the concept of normalizations.
                         A custom directive defined in the JavaScript is defined using CAMEL CASE.
                         AngularJS sees the camel case and converts it as a string seperated by -
                         in the HTML(view). The - are added when the upper case letters are 
                         added -->

                    <!-- A custom directive defined in the javascript (either as part of the 
                         app.js or as a seperate directives.js file) can be used over here in 4 
                         different ways. What can be allowed or restricted  in HTML is defined in 
                         the "restrict"property of the object that is returned by the custom      
                         directive(see JS).
                         1) Element - Use 'E' in the restrict property.
                         2) Attribute - Use 'A' in the restrict property.
                         3) Class - Use 'C' in the restrict property.
                         4) Comment - Use 'M' in the restrict property.
                         A combination of these 4 letters can be used. By default E and A are ON.
                         If class and comment has to be used, they need to be turned ON by 
                         specifying C and M in the restrict property. -->

                    <!-- When using custom directives, the scope that is defined in the 
                         controller that is the parent of the custom directive gets applied
                         to the directive. As a result, any scope variable in the myController
                         will become available within searchResult.html. This can lead to 
                         undesirable results if a large application is using custom directives
                         and if any of the child modifies the scope, the parent scope in 
                         myController is changed. To restrict this, we create a wall by using
                         the "scope" property in directive.js. This wall can then be poked to 
                         allow any parent scope variable from myController to be accessed by the
                         searchResult.html. The scope is done in directive.js and then they are
                         normalized and used as attributes to the custom directives used here.-->                  
                    <search-result-text bank-name="{{bank.name}}"
                                        bank-motto="{{bank.motto}}"
                                        bank-message="{{bank.message}}">
                    </search-result-text>

                    <!-- Object binding by using "=". This is two way binding.-->
                    
                    <!-- The entire bank object needs to be passed. Using {{}} would 
                         mean that we are passing the "text of the object". That doesn't
                         make sense, so for interpolation, we are just passing along the
                          entire bank object without the actual {{}}.-->
                    
                    <!-- The custom directive searcResultObject also expects a function called
                         formattedAddressFunction to be passed to it as function. The function
                         being passed is the ohWhatFun defined in the myController. The parameter
                         someBank passed to the ohWhatFun function here is just a place holder
                         that indicates the number of paremeters to be passed. The mapping on 
                         the parameter will be completed in the directive template using an 
                         object map -->
